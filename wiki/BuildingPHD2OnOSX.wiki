#summary Building PHD2 on OSX

= Building PHD2 on OSX =

 * Install CMake, the cross-platform build system

    http://www.cmake.org/download/

 * Install Xcode 4 or Xcode 5

  Our official builds are done with Xcode 4, but Xcode 5 can be used for development.

 * Download and build wxWidgets-3.0.2

   http://wxwidgets.org/downloads/

cd to the wxWidgets-3.0.2 source directory and run the following commands to build wxWidgets 32-bit static libs and install them to a location $WXWIN

{{{
./configure --enable-universal_binary=i386,x86_64 --disable-shared --with-libpng=builtin --with-cocoa --prefix=$WXWIN \
             --with-macosx-sdk=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/ \
             --with-macosx-version-min=10.7 \
             CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11" \
             OBJCXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11" \
             CPPFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"  \
             LDFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++" CXX=clang++ CXXCPP="clang++ -E" CC=clang CPP="clang -E"
make
make install
}}}

 * Get the phd2 source code

   https://code.google.com/p/open-phd-guiding/source/checkout

Checkout the open-phd-guiding source tree into a directory of your choice. We'll refer to this location as $PHD2_SRC.

 * Generate the XCode project file

{{{
cd $PHD2_SRC
mkdir -p tmp
cd tmp
cmake -G Xcode -DwxWidgets_PREFIX_DIRECTORY=$WXWIN ..
}}}

 * Build and run PHD2

Open the Xcode project

   $PHD2_SRC/tmp/PHD2.xcodeproj

You can now build and run PHD2.
