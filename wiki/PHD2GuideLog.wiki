#summary Description of guide log format

= PHD2 Guide Log Format =

The PHD2 Guide Log records information about each camera frame while calibrating or guiding.

Each time calibration or guiding starts a new section is added to the log. Each section consists of a summary of calibration or guiding settings, a column label line, and lines for the camera frames.

The lines for the camera frames are in comma-separated value (CSV) format.

There may be informational lines interspersed with the CSV lines indicating events that affect guiding, such as guiding parameter changes. These lines all start with {{{INFO:}}}.

All distances and positions are in units of guide camera pixels.

= Calibration section =

The calibration section columns are:

|| *Column* || *Description* ||
|| Direction || calibration step direction ||
|| Step || step number ||
|| dx || x-axis distance from starting point ||
|| dy || y-axis distance from starting point ||
|| x || x position ||
|| y || y position ||
|| Dist || distance from starting position ||

= Guiding section =

The guiding section columns are:

|| *Column* || *Description* ||
|| Frame || Frame number ||
|| Time || elapsed time from start of guiding ||
|| mount || guide correction device "Mount" or "AO", or "DROP" if camera frame was rejected ||
|| dx || X distance from lock position ||
