#summary OpenPHD Event Monitoring interface

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

OpenPHD allows programs to connect to PHD to actively monitor guiding status and control PHD. This allows clients to do things like:
  * graph phd data in real time
  * monitor phd for exceptional events like guiding lost, and send an alert when something goes wrong
  * control PHD remotely

= Connection =

Clients connect to PHD on TCP port 4400. When multiple PHD instances are running, each instance listens on successive port numbers (4401, 4402, ...).

PHD allows multiple clients to establish connections simultaneously.

When a client establishes a connection, PHD sends a series of event notification messages to the client (see [#Initial_Messages]). Then, as guiding events take place in PHD, notification messages are sent to all connected clients.

= Event Notification Messages =

== Event Notification Message Format ==

Event Notification messages are formatted as [http://www.json.org/ JSON] objects. Each message is a single line of text terminated by CR LF.

== Common attributes ==

All messages contain the following attributes in common:

|| Attribute || Type || Description ||
||`Event` || string || the name of the event ||
|| `Timestamp` || number || the timesamp of the event in seconds from the epoch, including fractional seconds ||
|| `Host` || string || the hostname of the machine running PHD ||
|| `Inst` || number || the PHD instance number (1-based) ||

== Event Message Descriptions ==

Here are the available messages and the attributes of each message.

== Initial Event Messages ==

When a client first connects, PHD sends a series of event messages to the client. The first event is
 * `Version`
Then, one or more of
 * `LockPositionSet`
 * `StarSelected`
 * `CalibrationComplete`
 * `StartGuiding`, `StartCalibration`, or `Paused`
depending on the state of PHD.

Finally, PHD will send
 * `AppState`

= PHD Server method invocation =

PHD2 provides an RPC (remote procedure call) interface for event server clients. The message protocol is [http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification JSON RPC 2.0].

Requests are sent as a single line of text, terminated by `CR LF`. Responses from the server are also a single line of text terminated by `CR LF`.

Here is an example exchange between client ({{{-->}}}) and server ({{{<--}}}):

Get current camera exposure time:
{{{
--> {"method": "get_exposure", "id": 1}
<-- {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": 1000, "id": 1}
}}}

Set camera exposure:
{{{
--> {"method": "set_exposure", "params": [1500], "id": 2}
<-- {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": 0, "id": 2}
}}}

Set camera exposure (error):
{{{
--> {"method": "set_exposure", "params": [1502], "id": 3}
<-- {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": 1, "message": "could not set exposure duration"}, "id": 3}

=== Settle parameter ===

The `SETTLE` parameter is used by the `guide` and `dither` commands to specify when PHD2 should consider guiding to be stable enough for imaging. `SETTLE` is an object with the following attributes:
 * `pixels` - maximum guide distance for guiding to be considered stable or "in-range"
 * `time` - minimum time to be in-range before considering guiding to be stable
 * `timeout` - time limit before settling is considered to have failed

So, for example, to request settling at less than 1.5 pixels for at least 10 seconds, with a time limit of 60 seconds, the settle object parameter would be:
{{{
{"pixels": 1.5, "time": 10, "timeout": 60}
}}}

=== Guide Method ===

The `guide` method allows a client to request PHD2 to do whatever it needs to start guiding and to report when guiding is settled and stable.

When the `guide` method command is received, PHD2 will respond immediately indicating that the `guide` sequence has started. The `guide` method will return an error status if equipment is not connected. PHD will then:

 * start capturing if necessary
 * auto-select a guide star if one is not already selected
 * calibrate if necessary, or if the RECALIBRATE parameter is true
 * wait for calibration to complete
 * start guiding if necessary
 * wait for settle (or timeout)
 * report progress of settling for each exposure (send `Settling` events)
 * report success or failure by sending a `SettleDone` event.

If the `guide` command is accepted, PHD is guaranteed to send a `SettleDone` event some time later indicating the success or failure of the guide sequence.

Example
{{{
{"method": "guide", "params": [{"pixels": 1.5, "time": 8, "timeout": 40}, false], "id": 42}
}}}

=== Dither Method ===

The `dither` method allows the client to request a random shift of the lock position by +/- PIXELS on each of the RA and Dec axes. If the RA_ONLY parameter is true, or if the Dither RA Only option is set in the Brain, the dither will only be on the RA axis. The PIXELS parameter is multiplied by the Dither Scale value in the Brain.

Like the `guide` method, the `dither` method takes a `SETTLE` object parameter. PHD will send `Settling` and `SettleDone` events to indicate when guiding has stabilized after the dither.

Example
{{{
{"method": "dither", "params": [10, false, {"pixels": 1.5, "time": 8, "timeout": 40}], "id": 42}
}}}
