<br><h3><a name="Astronomical_seeing"></a>Astronomical Seeing and Guiding</h3><o:p></o:p><p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s difficult to get far in imaging and guiding without
coming to grips with astronomical seeing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a complex subject so only the bare minimum can be covered here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Seeing&#8221; is the term given to the positional jitter
and sudden brightness changes of stars we see (or photograph) through a
telescope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the naked eye, we see
this as &#8220;twinkling&#8221; because our eye can&#8217;t resolve the tiny positional movements
of the star. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is atmospheric
turbulence, caused by the movement of thermal cells at various levels in the
Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Light is refracted as it passes through each atmospheric
cell, so when you look at a star, you&#8217;re really looking up through a column of
air that is behaving like a column of little lenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The refraction of the light by each cell
depends on its temperature, and the cells generally have different
temperatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because the atmosphere
is very dynamic, these elements are all moving around at various speeds, coming
into and then leaving the column of air you&#8217;re looking through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Particularly with longer focal lengths, this
atmospheric seeing is the single biggest source of the guide star movement we
see with a properly working mount, and it can&#8217;t be &#8220;guided out&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
movement of the atmospheric cells means
the guide star position is changing at rates of 10&#8217;s to 1000&#8217;s of times
per
second, and amateur-grade equipment, even adaptive optics devices,
can&#8217;t react
quickly enough to correct for it. Professional observatories are able
to do it
to a large extent by employing very expensive measurement devices,
artificial
stars, and mechanisms that can both deform the mirror and shift the
image at
very high frequencies. &nbsp;For these observatories, most
of the seeing disturbances originate in the upper layers of the
atmosphere and those are&nbsp;the layers that are used for seeing
models and most seeing forecasts. &nbsp;For amateurs and
especially for those who image from urban or backyard locations, seeing
problems also arise from sources close to the telescope. &nbsp;Heat
convection from hard ground surfaces or neighboring rooftops create
lower frequency "boiling" behavior that degrade guiding and imaging
performance. &nbsp;Ground-level heat can also create tube currents and
uneven layers of hot air inside the telescope tube - these also can
masquerade as low-frequency seeing effects. &nbsp;Users should do what
they can to avoid or mitigate these situations and, when working in
locations with high daytime temperatures, should expect it will take
many hours after sunset for the equipment temperatures to equilibrate. <o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>From a guiding perspective, we are always &#8220;under-sampling&#8221; the
seeing behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the time we&#8217;ve taken
an exposure, downloaded the image, computed the location of the guide stars,
and then transmitted a guide command, the star position on the sensor has moved
&#8211; probably 100&#8217;s of times.<span style="">&nbsp;
As the exposure time decreases, these measurement errors become even
larger, a phenomenon known as "aliasing". You're exposed to aliasing
any time you watch a TV show or a film that has rapidly spinning
objects like automobile wheels. &nbsp;Over the years, you've been
conditioned to ignore it but, really, are those car wheels actually
spinning backwards during the chase scene? &nbsp;This aliasing effect
happens because the exposure rate of the film equipment - e.g. 60
frames/sec - is too slow to accurately meaure the movement of the
spinning objects. &nbsp; Getting back to auto-guiding</span>,
we&#8217;re always dealing with outdated information about the actual guide star position &#8211; and that doesn&#8217;t even take into
account whatever shortcomings the mount has in precisely executing the guide
commands it receives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
star movements we <i style="">can</i> correct for -
drift, periodic error, atmospheric refraction, mechanical deflections, etc - are hiding in a sea of
noise created by the seeing conditions.<span style="">
One of the major objectives of the PHD2 guide algorithms is to identify
and react to the tracking errors that can be corrected while ignoring
the spurious effects of seeing that can't be corrected. </span>&nbsp; Your choice of &nbsp;guide camera exposure times can make this job easier.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><big>Seeing and
Exposure Times</big><o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">The high-frequency, seeing-induced star motion seen by the
guide camera is strongly affected by the length of your guide exposure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Look at the following plot to see how the observed range
of guide star motion decreases as the exposure time is increased:<o:p></o:p></p>
<img style="width: 717px; height: 447px;" alt="" src="Supplemental_Graph_Seeing.png"><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">Essentially, the camera sensor is averaging the changing
light pattern of the star and smoothing the result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Measurement uncertainty is still present
because of under-sampling, but the longer exposures make it easier for PHD2 to
isolate and identify the lower frequency errors that really can be improved
through guiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, there is a
practical upper limit to the exposure time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Typically, it will be limited by the length of time your mount can run
on its own without needing a correction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Small errors from periodic error, drift, flexure and other sources need
to be corrected before they become large enough to ruin an image.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding the right balance will always depend
on both the seeing conditions and the quality of the equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a starting point in PHD2, we typically
recommend using exposure times of around 2 seconds and lower exposures
of at least 0.5 sec only if the mount requires it and then only if
guiding is active on multiple stars.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Binning_usage"></a>Use
of Binning</span></h3>
Many of the guide cameras available in PHD2 support hardware-level
binning, which may be helpful in&nbsp;situations where you are guiding
at
long focal lengths or have a guide camera with very small pixels. These
scenarios often result in having to use&nbsp;faint guide stars, and
the
guider images may be substantially over-sampled.
&nbsp;Over-sampling
provides no real benefit, and the projection of a faint star disk onto
many small pixels can result in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
&nbsp;By binning the image, you can reduce the impact of camera
read
noise and thus improve the SNR; and if you are over-sampled,
&nbsp;you
won't degrade the accuracy of computing the&nbsp;guide star
location.
&nbsp;Choosing a binning factor greater than one will have the
following effects:<br>
<ol>
<li>Star images will have a higher SNR and
will be easier to detect above the background noise level.
&nbsp;This
is especially helpful if you are limited to using faint stars
(i.e. with SNR values below about 10).</li>
<li>The amount of
data downloaded from the camera will&nbsp;be reduced by the square
of
the binning factor. &nbsp;This can be helpful if you are using a
camera
that&nbsp;makes heavy use of USB resources even if star brightness
and
SNR are already reasonable with un-binned images. &nbsp;Of course,
using sub-frames can achieve the same result once a star has been
selected.</li>
<li>The resolution (image scale) of your guider image
will be reduced by the binning factor. &nbsp;This is not likely to
be a
problem if the un-binned image scale is below 1 arc-sec/pixel, but your
guiding results may suffer if the un-binned image scale
is&nbsp;above 2.5
arc-sec/pixel. &nbsp;You may need to experiment because the results
will also depend on the image scale of your main camera system.</li>
</ol>
Each
binning level requires its own&nbsp;dark frames and bad-pixel map -
they are not interchangeable, nor can a transform be done
automatically. &nbsp;If you want the flexibility of switching back
and forth
between binning settings, you should create separate profiles for each
binning value. &nbsp;Then build&nbsp;a dark library and a
bad-pixel map
for
each of those profiles. &nbsp;When you want to change binning
factors,
just switch to the profile that has the setting you want, and a dark
library and/or bad-pixel map will be available. &nbsp; If you want
to
check that the camera is binning correctly, you can use the <a href="Visualization.htm#Stats_Display">Stats</a>
window to confirm the frame size and current on-camera bin settings.
&nbsp;Even if you've made a firm decision to change the binning, you
should create a new profile using the new-profile-wizard - that will
automatically adjust all of the guiding parameters that depend on image
scale. &nbsp;From a guiding perspective, a change in binning is
essentially the same as switching to a different camera.<br>
<h3><a name="Dithering_Ops"></a>Dithering</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">In order to reduce fixed-pattern noise
and hot pixels, imagers often move the telescope by very small amounts between
exposures &#8211; this is called dithering. Dithering is always controlled by the imaging
app because it is the only one that can suspend exposures with the main camera
while the pointing position is being shifted.&nbsp; PHD2&#8217;s only role in this is
to issue guide commands that will accomplish the requested shift in position &#8211;
it is simply doing that it&#8217;s told. The small shift in pointing position is accomplished&nbsp; by PHD2 in two steps:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">1.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change</span><span style=""> the lock-point of the primary guide star by the
amount requested by the imaging app.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">2.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Use the normal guiding routines to move the primary
guide star to the new lock-point<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">The size of the dither is&nbsp;controlled by the imaging
app, at least indirectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The app may
let you specify the maximum size of a dither, typically in units of
pixels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, PHD2 interprets this
as the upper range of random values between zero and this limit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The randomizing process is done </span><span style="">to insure
that dithering doesn't follow a simplistic back-and-forth pattern or shift the
frame back to a location where it has previously been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>For some&nbsp;applications that do
PHD2 dithering, you can't specify the maximum amount directly - you are perhaps
limited to choices like small/medium/large and the max dither amounts will have
preset values.&nbsp; For that reason, PHD2 has a dither scaling parameter in
the 'Global' tab of the Advanced Settings dialog.&nbsp; It is basically a
multiplier term that lets you adjust the range of dither amounts that are
possible.&nbsp; So a scale factor of 1 doesn't change the preset value at all,
a value of 10 multiplies it by 10X, etc.&nbsp; If you're using an app that lets
you specify the maximum amount directly (e.g. PHD_Dither), you should leave the
dither scale set to 1.0.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can adjust the scale factor if
you aren't happy with the overall range of dithering you're getting with one of
the small/medium/large choices..<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">It&#8217;s
up to the imaging app to determine
when the guiding has settled down and it&#8217;s time to start the next
exposure with the&nbsp; main camera.&nbsp; To make this easier for
authors of the imaging apps, PHD2 provides
some extra measurement information on how the settling process is
proceeding.&nbsp; This information doesn&#8217;t need to be used by the
imaging app,
it is entirely optional.&nbsp; In order to take advantage of this help,
the
imaging app specifies what level of stability it wants to see in order
to
decide that the dithering activity has settled down.&nbsp; There are
three
settling parameters for doing this:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">1.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;The maximum amount of guide star
position error that is considered acceptable &#8211; call that position tolerance, <b>PT</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">2.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The length&nbsp; of time that must elapse during
which the guide star position error stays below the position tolerance &#8211; call
that the evaluation time, <b>ET</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">3.</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The maximum amount of time that can be tolerated
before the measurement process is terminated and the dither is declared to be
&#8220;done&#8221; regardless of the guiding stability &#8211; call that the time-out period, <b>TO</b><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">To state this in a sentence, the
settling process is &#8220;done&#8221; when the guiding error is &lt;= <b>PT</b> for <b>ET</b>
seconds or, if that condition is never satisfied, after <b>TO</b> seconds have
expired.&nbsp; When this evaluation process is complete, PHD2 sends a message
to the imaging app saying settling is done.&nbsp; This is all just extra credit
for PHD2, normal guiding is being done from the time the lock-point is moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">Of course, the specification of these
parameters, <b>PT</b>, <b>ET</b>, and <b>TO</b>,
is up to you and the values
have to be chosen intelligently. Your imaging app may not expose all of
these parameters in its user interface or it may give them different
names.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re dithering by large amounts
with a low-performance mount, you have to expect it will take a long
time to
settle down.&nbsp; If you specify a <b>PT</b> value that is too large or an <b>ET</b>
value that is too small (overly lax parameters), the imaging app may start the
next exposure too soon and you could get streaked stars in the image.&nbsp; The same problem could occur if you specify a <b>TO</b>
value that is too short.&nbsp; Conversely, if you specify a <b>PT</b> value
that is too small or an <b>ET</b> value that is too long (overly demanding
parameters), then all of your dithers will incur a delay of <b>TO</b>
seconds&nbsp;and settling will "fail" &#8211; you are asking too much from
your mount.&nbsp; A sensible approach is to look at your past performance to
see how well your mount responds under typical seeing conditions with the size
of dithering you want to use.&nbsp; If your mount has a lot of Dec backlash,
you should see how long it takes for guiding to settle down when the direction
of the Dec guide command is reversed.&nbsp; The <b>ET</b> and <b>PT</b>
values
should reflect the guiding performance you normally get with your setup
with a
little bit of slack to avoid wasting time. &nbsp;Occasional timeouts
during settling are fairly common and typically don't cause problems
but you should check your guide logs using the LogViewer tool to be
sure the main camera exposure isn't being started while large
corrections are still being done by PHD2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="">PHD2 also supports different choices
for how the star is moved in RA and Dec.<span style="">
With the default settings, the mount will be shifted in RA and Dec by
different&nbsp; random amounts as described earlier.&nbsp;
</span>If you choose &#8220;spiral mode&#8221;, the guide star will be moved in a pattern
that eventually produces a spiral pattern around the original lock-point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This automatically reduces the number of Dec
reversals and can be a good choice if your mount has substantial backlash. In
this mode, there is no randomizing process involved, each dither has the size
specified by the imaging app.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
you can choose the RA-only option and eliminate Dec reversals
altogether, but
this may not be a good choice if your imaging camera has a lot of
fixed-pattern
noise. When deciding &nbsp;how to specify the size of the
dithers, you need to take into account the image scales of both your
guiding setup and your main imaging system. For CMOS imaging
cameras, you may find advice to do large dithers, perhaps 10-20 pixels.
&nbsp;But this means 10-20 pixels on the main camera sensor, not the
guide camera sensor, so you need to calculate how much movement
is needed on the guide camera to achieve the desired displacement on
the imaging camera. &nbsp;It will quite often be less.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;">If your mount has a substantial amount of declination
backlash in the mount, you may be guiding in only the north or south Dec
direction. &nbsp;If PHD2 receives a command to dither in declination while you're
operating in this mode, it will temporarily allow guiding in both Dec
directions until the dither and settling are completed. &nbsp;It will then
revert to the original north/south-only guiding mode. &nbsp;If you don't want
this behavior, you should restrict dithering to 'RA-only'. &nbsp;All of the
PHD2 dither controls are contained on the 'Global' tab of the Advanced Settings
dialog.</p><h3><a name="Common_mount_problems"></a>Common Mount Mechanical Problems<o:p></o:p></h3>

<h3>Periodic Error in Right Ascension (PE)<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">Periodic error is most often caused by very small machining
errors in the various components of the RA drive system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One part of a typical drive system is shown
here:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 489px; height: 313px;" alt="" src="Supplement_RA_Gears.png"></p><p class="MsoNormal">Credit: Mathis Instruments</p><p class="MsoNormal">

</p><p class="MsoNormal">A high-precision worm gear (arrow 1) is used to drive the
much larger worm wheel (arrow 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter is attached to the RA shaft and when the mount is tracking at the
sidereal rate, the worm wheel will complete a rotation in one sidereal day
(23.934 hours).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order for this
tracking to be perfect, all&nbsp;the following conditions must be met:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Identical&nbsp;pitch and spacing for every thread in the worm gear<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Rigid attachment of the worm gear to the mounting plate with
no flexure or movement of the gear or the mounting blocks<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Identical shape and spacing of every tooth in the worm wheel<o:p></o:p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Worm wheel perfectly round and perfectly centered on its
axis of rotation<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These are actually just a few of the necessary conditions,
but it&#8217;s obvious that this level of precision is not likely to be present in most
amateur mounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The machining of the
worm gear is usually the biggest challenge so tracking errors often originate
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The worm gear turns at a constant
rate during sidereal tracking and the time it takes to make one full revolution
is called the &#8220;worm period&#8221;. Worm periods vary among different mounts but
generally fall in the range of 4 to 10 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A machining inaccuracy on one of the worm threads will therefore make
its presence known once in every worm period. Of course, many of the worm gear
threads are likely to have some inaccuracies and each will make its own
contribution to tracking error once during the worm period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the tracking error is graphed over a
single worm period, the result is usually a curve that is roughly sinusoidal
with varying slopes, peaks, and valleys &#8211; this is what is known as periodic
error. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Here&#8217;s an example:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 765px; height: 484px;" alt="" src="Supplement_Example_PE.png"><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

</p><p class="MsoNormal">Notice the high-frequency movements caused by seeing that
are not part of the mechanical periodic error.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are other gears in the RA system, often a series of
gears that lie between the motor and the worm gear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are required to convert from the native
speed of the motor to the slower rotation speed of the worm gear and also to
generate the torque needed to drive the worm gear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of these components will have machining
inaccuracies of its own and will contribute to cumulative tracking errors of
the mount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of these components will
introduce errors on shorter time periods than the worm period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some mounts use drive belts to sidestep some
of these &#8220;upstream&#8221; gear inaccuracies but those can introduce errors of their
own &#8211; incorrect tensioning, lateral movement of the belt on spindles, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><a name="RA_periodic_error"></a>RA Periodic Error Correction<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">Periodic error correction (PEC) in the mount firmware is
beneficial to auto-guiding if the feature is implemented correctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t always the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when done correctly, periodic
error correction handles some tracking errors before they are seen in the guide
camera image.<span style="">&nbsp; These corrections</span> are predictive, based
on a model of the mount&#8217;s PE, as opposed to being reactive like normal
auto-guiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The net result is that
PHD2 has less work to do to keep the RA axis on-target.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even when the implementation in the mount is done well,
calculation of a high-quality PEC curve must be done carefully using an
application specific to the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the measurement process, the app must filter out
seeing-induced
guide star movements to produce a smooth correction curve that
represents
samples across multiple worm periods. It must also be aware of the worm
period
and the various harmonics in the mount drive system in order to apply
corrections only for those tracking errors that are harmonic - i.e.
errors with frequencies that are integer multiples of the worm
frequency.<span style=""> &nbsp; If the PE correction curve is poorly constructed, the RA tracking can be worse than using no PEC at all.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">If PEC isn't available for your mount or is badly implemented, you can use the PPEC guide algorithm in PHD2. <span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;"></span><a href="Guide_algorithms.htm#Predictive_PEC">PHD2 Predictive PEC</a><span style=""> </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<h3><o:p></o:p><a name="Dec_backlash"></a>Declination Backlash and Stiction</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Backlash
can occur when the direction of motion on an axis is reversed. The
telescope may not immediately start moving in the reverse direction
even though the motor is turning. The usual cause is loose meshing of
the gears in the drive train. &nbsp;For auto-guiding, this problem
doesn't affect guiding in RA because the RA drive system is
continuously moving the axis west as it tracks the sky - it never reverses direction because of guiding. &nbsp;But it is
a common source of trouble for Declination because the Dec axis is
mostly idle during guiding, running only in short bursts in response to
guide commands to move the scope north or south.. &nbsp;A simple
picture of what causes backlash is shown here:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 336px; height: 219px;" alt="" src="Supplement_Backlash.png"></p><p class="MsoNormal">This
diagram shows two spur gears, but the basic principle also applies to
worm gear and worm wheel pairs. &nbsp;In the diagram above, assume the
bottom gear is the <span style="font-style: italic;">drive</span> gear&nbsp;currently rotating counter-clockwise. &nbsp;The teeth on the drive gear are in contact with the teeth on the <span style="font-style: italic;">driven</span>
gear
above it and the latter is being driven clockwise. &nbsp;But the arrows
show that the&nbsp;surface on the trailing edge of the drive gear tooth
is not touching the matching tooth on the driven gear - there is a
small gap. &nbsp;So when the drive gear reverses direction, there will
be a short period of time before the gears are fully meshed and the
driven gear starts turning in the opposite direction. &nbsp;The
"reversal delay" in this case is caused by simple backlash. &nbsp;Some
amount of gap is generally required to avoid binding in the gear system
and to allow room for lubricant and thermal expansion. &nbsp;When the
mesh is too tight, the axis may exhibit stiction (static friction), a
situation where the axis will not move smoothly and freely or is
difficult to get moving from a stationary state. &nbsp;Stiction on the
Dec axis can result in a pattern of an initial reversal delay that
looks like backlash followed by a large over-shoot once the axis
finally starts moving. &nbsp;Other than mistakenly having backlash
compensation enabled in the mount software, stiction is the most common
cause of oscillations in Dec guiding. &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Guiding Assistant will
measure how the Dec axis behaves when it is forced to reverse
direction. &nbsp;It is only capable of measuring the "reversal delay",
the amount of time it takes to change direction and get the axis
rotating at the expected rate. &nbsp;It isn't always possible to
distinguish whether the problem is backlash, stiction, or both; but the
graph produced by the GA can often provide clues. &nbsp;This behavior
can also be seen during normal guiding sessions that don't employ the
large guide pulses used by the GA. If the reversal delay is large, say
above 3 seconds, it's probably best to try adjusting the Dec drive
system. &nbsp;If the delay is less than that, the PHD2 Dec Backlash
Compensation feature will probably be able to handle Dec reversals
fairly well. &nbsp;Note that the amount of delay is inversely
proportional to the guide speed in the mount - as the guide speed is
increased, the reversal delay decreases. &nbsp;This is one of the
reasons we recommend using guide speeds of at least 0.5x sidereal.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
reversal delay is usually not a constant value for the mount.
&nbsp;Instead, it often depends on the pointing position of the scope
and the balance of the scope on the Dec axis. &nbsp;As mounts age, the
gears wear and for Dec, the wear will be greatest where the scope
spends most of its time during imaging. &nbsp;For northern observers,
that is probably in the Dec range of 0 to 40 degrees. &nbsp;With older
mounts especially, the reversal delay can be quite different in those
pointing positions than, for example, regions closer to the pole.
&nbsp;This is another reason why the PHD2 Backlash Compensation feature
is a better choice than any fixed-size compensation that is programmed
in the mount controller.</p>
<h3><a name="Declination-Uni-directional_guiding"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uni-directional
Declination Guiding</span></h3>
As
discussed above, some mounts may have too much reveral delay in Dec to
support guiding in both&nbsp;north and south directions.
&nbsp;This
situation can be mitigated by configuring PHD2 to guide in only
one&nbsp;direction, what we call uni-directional Dec guiding.
&nbsp;This is
a viable option because declination guiding is only intended to
correct for slow drift - errors caused by polar misalignment and to a
lesser extent, mechanical flexure. &nbsp;Ironically, you might want
to
de-tune your polar alignment a bit to make it easier to see the drift
direction and to reduce the likelihood that seeing will interfere with
uni-directional guiding. &nbsp;Remember that polar mis-alignment,
within
reason, doesn't usually degrade guiding performance. &nbsp;Instead,
it
may introduce field rotation if you're imaging near the pole and have a
large camera sensor. &nbsp;A good first step would be to polar
align to
within 5-10 arc-min of the pole before setting up for
uni-directional
guiding. &nbsp;You can always go back later and check for field
rotation. &nbsp;Just take a sample image with your main camera at
the
highest declination you would expect for imaging - perhaps 70 degrees
north. &nbsp;If you don't see field rotation there, you can leave
the
polar alignment where it is. &nbsp;With any amount of polar
mis-alignment, the direction of&nbsp; Dec corrections will change
at
some point in the sky. &nbsp;(Technically, it will reverse
directions
at two points in the sky but one of those is usually below the
horizon.) &nbsp;The sky location for the reversal
depends&nbsp;on
how you are mis-aligned on the pole - the relative amounts of azimuth
and altitude alignment errors. &nbsp;If most of &nbsp;the
polar
alignment error is in altitude, the point of direction reversal should
be near the celestial meridian, about the time a meridian flip is
required.<br>
<br>
To set up for uni-directional guiding, you can follow these steps:<br>
<ol>
<li>Move
to a field with a good guide star and run the Guiding Assistant for
several minutes. &nbsp;Look at the guiding graph and note whether
the
guide star is drifting&nbsp;north or
south. &nbsp;Once you see this, reset the Dec guide mode to issue
corrections in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">opposite</span>
direction. &nbsp;For example, if the
star is
drifting north, set the Guide mode to 'south.'</li>
<li>Try
using the&nbsp;'LowPass2' guiding algorithm for declination and
start
with a fairly low aggressiveness factor, say 50%. &nbsp;If the
aggressiveness is too high, the correction may push the star to the
"wrong" side of the lock position, where it will remain until the slow
drift rate moves it back. &nbsp;It's better to issue a
few&nbsp;small
corrections rather than one larger one in order to minimize this
type of over-shoot.</li>
<li>Watch the guiding graph to be sure the
corrections are being issued in the right direction and the star isn't
just steadily drifting&nbsp;off-target. &nbsp;Over the course
of
minutes or hours, you may notice the amount of drift is decreasing.
&nbsp;This means you are slowly approaching the point of
declination reversal and you should be prepared to change the Dec guide
mode accordingly.</li>
<li>If you are dithering, you may want to set the dithering
parameters to "RA-only" to avoid disrupting the Dec guiding. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>If dithering is being done through the PHD2 server interface,
uni-directional Dec guiding will be temporarily switched to 'Auto' in
order to execute dithers. &nbsp;This may result in extended settling
times but it allows the kind of dithering that is required for cameras
with fixed-pattern noise. Once settling is completed, the Dec guide
mode will be restored to its original setting. &nbsp;This only works
via the server interface,&nbsp;dithering done using the 'Manual Guide'
tool will not suspend uni-directional guiding in this way.. &nbsp;
<h3><a name="Variable_delay_guiding"></a>High-precision Mounts and Variable-delay Guiding</h3>

<p class="xxxmsonormal">Mounts with very accurate absolute encoders and detailed
pointing models often allow imaging without any guiding at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there are limitations to how long this
can be done without needing some guiding corrections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The goal in this scenario is to provide a &#8220;backup&#8221;
guiding mechanism that won&#8217;t conflict with the inputs from encoders and
pointing models and will still improve the overall result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recommended strategy for accomplishing
this is as follows:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="xxxmsolistparagraph" style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 40px;">1.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Keep the frequency of guide commands as low as possible.&nbsp;
These mounts can actually be quite &#8220;busy&#8221; with corrections coming from encoders
and fine-grained pointing models, none of which are visible to ASCOM applications.&nbsp;
A slow guiding frequency will minimze the potential for creating instabilities in
these functions from external guide commands.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="xxxmsolistparagraph" style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 40px;">2.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Be especially carefully to avoid chasing the seeing &#8211; this is most easily
done by using moderate-length or long guide camera exposures and generous
min-move settings.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="xxxmsonormal">In previous PHD2 releases, users have been able to approximate
this approach by using exposures in the 4-8 second range, coupled with a
non-zero &#8220;time lapse&#8221; delay.&nbsp; The latter simply imposes a fixed delay
between the completion of the last guide command and the start of the next
guide camera exposure.&nbsp; The downside of this approach is that operations
other than steady-state guiding &#8211; things like looping, star selection,
calibrating, dithering and settling, etc. &#8211; are unnecessarily slowed by the
time-lapse value.&nbsp; The &#8220;variable delay&#8221; feature eliminates this problem by
letting the user specify two different delay values:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="xxxmsolistparagraph" style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 40px;">1.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;A &#8220;short&#8221; delay that will be used for any activity other
than
steady-state guiding.&nbsp; This might be zero but at least for some
mounts, it should be non-zero to allow time for the encoders to finish
their
corrections.&nbsp; Values above 1 second are probably unnecessary.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="xxxmsolistparagraph" style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 40px;">2.<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A &#8220;long&#8221; delay that will be used for the normal frame-frame guiding that
is typical of steady-state,&nbsp; long-exposure imaging.&nbsp; This is the value, in addition to
the camera exposure time, that controls the &#8220;cadence&#8221; of the guiding.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="xxxmsonormal">&nbsp;To give an example, you might use camera exposures of 4
seconds, a &#8220;short&#8221; delay of 1 second, and&nbsp;a &#8220;long&#8221; delay of 4
seconds.&nbsp; The 4-second exposure time will provide good suppression of
seeing-related effects and the sum of (4+4) seconds results in a steady
8-second guiding cadence for most of the imaging session.&nbsp; At the same
time, the dither settling times will benefit from the short (4+1) second delays between
camera exposures.</p><h3><a name="Differential_flexure"></a>Differential Flexure<o:p></o:p></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">Any telescope/camera combination is going to flex and sag in
various ways as it tracks an object in the sky &#8211; that&#8217;s just a consequence of
gravity and physics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, each
individual component is going to exhibit its own unique behavior in this regard
depending on its mass and how it&#8217;s attached to its neighboring components. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Especially with larger scopes and heavier
cameras, the amount of flexure can be significant, keeping in mind that guiding
is dealing in units of a small number of microns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since we aren&#8217;t generally familiar with
dimensions this small, it&#8217;s useful to remember that a human hair is roughly 50
microns thick, roughly 10x larger than most guiding corrections.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When a separate guide scope is being used in addition to the
imaging scope, each unit will flex and shift independently &#8211; this is called
differential flexure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If PHD2 is using
the separate guide scope, it will only see and correct for the movements of the
guide scope/camera, the differential movements of the imaging scope/camera are
invisible. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This can lead to a fairly
common and frustrating problem where the guiding results are excellent but the
stars taken through the main camera are elongated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There will <b>always </b>be some amount of differential flexure
in a dual-scope system, it&#8217;s only a question of how large it is and whether it
is large enough to degrade your images.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For imaging scopes with focal lengths of 1800mm or greater, differential
flexure is usually a problem unless the main-camera exposures are kept fairly short.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s no way to predict this because there
are simply too many mechanical interface points that can move around &#8211; movable
SCT mirrors, all the connectors between the cameras and their focusers, the
focusers themselves, all the thumb-screw fasteners in the system, the mounting
ring arrangement for the guide scope, etc. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The typical solution is to eliminate the
dual-scope setup and use an off-axis-guider (OAG) on the imaging scope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allows PHD2 to &#8220;see&#8221; all the movements,
mechanical or otherwise, that will affect the main-camera images. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the early days, OAGs were often difficult
to use because their fields of view were small and usable guide stars were hard
to find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the current generation of
guide cameras and their large, highly sensitive sensors, most of these problems
are a thing of the past.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you have a situation where you frequently have elongated
stars but the guiding results show reasonably similar results for both Dec and
RA, you should suspect differential flexure. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>You can usually verify this fairly easily with
a simple test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Using the main camera,
with guiding active, find the largest exposure time that still has acceptably
round stars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then capture a sequence of perhaps
10-20 images at that exposure time. Using an app that is capable of displaying that
image set, &#8220;blink&#8221; through the images in the order they were captured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You will usually see a consistent offset of
the stars in each image relative to the previous image &#8211; the stars will appear
to &#8220;march&#8221; in a particular direction as you cycle through the image set. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Alternatively, you can simply stack all the
images without first aligning them to see the star elongation emerge.</p><h3><a name="AO_Devices"></a>Adaptive/Active Optics Devices</h3><p class="MsoNormal">Generally
speaking, amateur-grade adaptive/active optics (AO) devices can only
deal with some of the problems that create imperfect guiding.&nbsp;
AO&#8217;s can usually mask or at least improve the behavior of an
under-performing mount because most of the guiding adjustments are
accomplished by moving a small tip-tilt optical element &#8211; not 70 pounds
of telescope gear.&nbsp; Basically, the mount is rarely asked to do
anything beyond basic sidereal tracking.&nbsp; Problems with backlash,
stiction, and periodic error are mostly masked with AO use.&nbsp; In
addition, because an AO is inherently an off-axis-guider, it also
eliminates differential flexure problems.&nbsp; These are significant
benefits and explain why many serious imagers use AO&#8217;s. <br><br>What
an AO can&#8217;t eliminate is guide star movement due to seeing, at least
not under normal conditions.&nbsp; Guide star movement due to upper
atmosphere seeing occurs at frequencies of at least 100s/sec and it
isn&#8217;t usually practical to find guide stars that can be measured that
rapidly. If you attempt to run the AO at such high rates you will have
two problems: 1) Any available guide stars will probably have low SNR
values, and the calculation of their positions will degrade
proportionately; and 2) you will under-sample the seeing
deflections.&nbsp; The latter situation results in &#8220;aliasing&#8221;,
resulting in guide commands that are invariably incorrect and likely to
make things even worse.&nbsp; For these reasons, AO users are still
advised to use exposure times of no less than 0.5 second to avoid
chasing the seeing.&nbsp; The goal with AO guiding is really to make
the mount &#8220;look&#8221; better than it really is in terms of tracking accuracy
and responsiveness. &nbsp;If your imaging isn't limited by mount
performance, an AO is not likely to provide much benefit.<br><br>AO
guiding usually involves guide commands being directed, at times, to
both the AO and the mount.&nbsp; The commands are sent only to the AO
so long as the guide corrections don&#8217;t exceed the physical limits of
the tip-tilt element.&nbsp; As this limit is approached, &#8220;bump&#8221; guide
commands are sent to the mount to help restore the primary guide star
to a more central position of the tip-tilt element.&nbsp; This can
happen to correct for polar alignment drift, large guiding excursions
arising from external problems (e.g. cable snags) or for large
dithers.&nbsp; An explanation of how these guide commands are &#8220;blended&#8221;
is provided in the Advanced Settings/AO Parameters section of the
manual. &nbsp;<a href="Advanced_settings.htm#Other_Devices_Tab">AO Parameters</a><br><o:p></o:p></p>


<h3><a name="Logging_and_Debug_Output"></a>Logging
and Debug Output</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
automatically creates two types of log files: a debug log and a
guiding log. &nbsp;Both are very useful for different reasons.
&nbsp;The guide log is intentionally formatted to
allow easy interpretation by either a human reader or an external
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
example, the&nbsp;PHDLogView application (not
part of the PHD2 release) can produce a variety of graphs and summary
statistics based on data in the PHD2 guide log.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But the log can also be easily imported into
Excel or other applications for analysis and graphing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When importing into Excel, just specify&nbsp;a
comma&nbsp;as a
column separator. &nbsp;The
debug log
has a&nbsp; complete record of everything that was done in the <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
session, &nbsp;so it is very helpful in isolating any problems
you&nbsp; have. &nbsp;It also employs a human-friendly (albeit
verbose)
text format, so it's
not
difficult to examine the debug log to see what happened. &nbsp;If
you
need to report a problem with the software, you will almost certainly
be asked to provide both log files. &nbsp;If you have neither
log
file available, you are unlikely to get any&nbsp;help. &nbsp;Note that log files are always created when PHD2 is run,
regardless of&nbsp;what was done (or not done) during the time that
PHD2 was running so you <span style="font-weight: bold;">will</span> have log files to support a request for help.<br>
<br>
The location for the files is controlled by the 'Log
File
Location' field in the 'Global' tab of the 'Advanced Settings' dialog.
&nbsp;By default, log
files
are stored in the OS-specific default directory for user documents.
&nbsp;In Windows, for example, the files will be stored in a '<span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>'
sub-folder in the "Documents" directory. &nbsp;This may not be a
convenient location, so you can specify a different folder using this
edit field. &nbsp;In order to prevent excessive accumulation of log
files, PHD2 automatically removes debug logs that are more than 30 days
old and guide logs that are more than 60 days old. &nbsp;If you
want to
retain the files for longer periods, you should move or copy them to a
different folder location, one not used by PHD2.<br>
<br>
To
simplify the automatic log upload process (see below), log data is
grouped by "imaging day", defined to be a 24-hour period beginning at
09:00 am local time.&nbsp; This means that all the PHD2 executions
on
the same imaging day will write guiding and debug log data into the two
log files for that imaging day. &nbsp; <br>
<br>In some unusual cases, you may need to capture guide
camera images, usually to support debugging and problem resolution.
&nbsp;This can be done by using the 'Enable diagnostic image logging'
controls on the 'Global' tab of Advanced Settings. The resultant image
files
will
be stored in the same location as the other log files and will be
written in the 'Fits' format for maximum fidelity. &nbsp;If you want to
capture a single guide camera frame, you can simply use the File/Save
Image... menu item.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Logging-Automatic_Upload"></a>Automatic Log File

<br>
</span>If you need help using PHD2 or improving your guiding
results, you can post a request on the Open<span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span>PHD-Guiding
forum (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-phd-guiding).
&nbsp;Your question should be accompanied by the PHD log files
associated with the guiding session you're talking about.
The debug log files are usually very large so you can't post them as
attachments - you should use the Upload tool described
below.&nbsp;Please
do not edit, trim, or rename the log files. To make uploading easier,
PHD2 has a built-in function to select, compress, and
automatically upload the relevant log files. That function is
located on the 'Help' menu. &nbsp;You'll see a dialog box that
shows
all the available log files, including their timestamps and duration:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 557px; height: 467px;" alt="" src="Log_Upload_1.png"><br>
<br>
Just
select the files you want and start the upload process by clicking on
'Next'. &nbsp;Please be careful to look at the 'Night Of' column&nbsp;to be sure the log covers the time period you're
interested in. &nbsp;PHD2 creates guide and debug log files every
time
it's run, so some of the log files will be nearly empty - don't upload
those. &nbsp; Be
selective about the files you choose - just the files for the session
you were having trouble with. &nbsp;When the upload process is
complete, you'll see another window that gives you a link to the files:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 573px; height: 192px;" alt="" src="Log_Upload_2.png"><br>
You
need to capture or record that link so it can be included with the
question you'll post on the forum. &nbsp; Log files will be
automatically removed on the server after a reasonable amount of time
has elapsed, so you won't need to worry about that. &nbsp;When you
post
your request for support, please include a full description of what you
were doing, whatever problem you saw, and roughly what time period you
want us to focus on.<br>

<h3><a name="Managing_Equipment_Profiles"></a>Managing
Equipment Profiles</h3>
Equipment profiles were introduced in the section on <a href="Basic_use.htm">Basic Use</a>
where they are used as part of the 'Connect Equipment' dialog.
&nbsp;If
you want to manage multiple profiles, you should use the
'Manage Profiles' button in the 'Connect Equipment' dialog.
&nbsp;Using
the menu items there, you can create a new profile
or&nbsp;edit/rename/delete an existing one. &nbsp;The most important
option and the one you are most likely to use is to launch the
New-Profile-Wizard, described in the Basic Use section of the manual.
This is the function that will configure the PHD2 settings that are
specific to your equipment configuration.&nbsp; Each profile
holds
all the settings that were active at the time the profile was last
used except for the dark and bad-pixel map files. &nbsp;To
edit the settings in an existing profile, you first select it in the
equipment profile drop-down list, then click on 'Settings' under the
'<a name="Manage_Profiles"></a>Manage Profiles'
pull-down. &nbsp;This will take you to the Advanced Settings
dialog, where you can make whatever changes you want.
&nbsp;Remember
that profiles are automatically updated anytime settings are changed
during a <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
session. Finally, you can import and export
profiles for purposes of debugging, backup, or&nbsp;exchange
between computers. &nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Migrating PHD2 Settings to a Different Computer</span><br><br>On
Windows, the profile information is kept in the Windows registry, so
you can't simply do file transfers to move your settings from one
computer to another. &nbsp;Instead, you should 'export' your profiles
into files on the old computer, copy those files to the new&nbsp;one,
then 'import' them on the new system. &nbsp;This will transfer all the
settings associated with the profile except for the dark libraries and
bad-pixel maps. The dark and bad-pix map data are stored in the file
system because of their size. They are located in the
'AppData\Local\PHD2' logical directory used by your operating system.
&nbsp;You will need to transfer that directory and all of its files to
the new computer manually without changing the directory location or
file names. &nbsp;That said, the best practice is to simply rebuild
them on the new system in order to have data that reflects the current
behavior of the guide camera sensor.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Ask_for_coordinates_aux_mount"></a>Aux-Mount
Connection using "Ask for coordinates"</h3>
If
you can't connect to your mount using either ASCOM or INDI drivers, you
still have a better-than-nothing alternative by using the&nbsp;"Ask
for
coordinates" aux-mount connection. &nbsp;With this option, you'll
be asked
to enter or confirm the scope position each time&nbsp;guiding is
going
to begin:: <br>
<br>
<img style="width: 212px; height: 248px;" alt="" src="Manual_mount.png"><br>
<br>
If
you enter your scope's current declination and east/west pointing position,
&nbsp;PHD2 will automatically adjust the calibration to
match&nbsp;that sky location. &nbsp;You don't need to be&nbsp;precise, a
Declination value that's within a few degrees will work. &nbsp;This
means you won't need to recalibrate as you slew to different targets
so long as you update these values each time. &nbsp;For
example,&nbsp; you can do a calibration near Declination=0 then
enter
new position values when you've slewed to a high declination imaging
target.
&nbsp;This is likely to produce a better result than trying to
calibrate at a near-pole position. &nbsp;This dialog will not be
displayed if the start of guiding is the result of a dither operation
or a server command from an imaging application. &nbsp;In order for
the
calibration adjustment to work correctly, your previous calibration <span style="font-weight: bold;">must </span>have been
completed&nbsp;with correct positioning data available. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you're using this option with the Drift Alignment tool, the dialog
will look a bit different: <br>
<br>
<img style="width: 327px; height: 350px;" alt="" src="Manual_mount_drift.png"><br>
<br>
If
you enter the additional information for Right Ascension, latitude, and
longitude, the Drift Alignment tool can more accurately adjust its
magenta target circle. &nbsp;Otherwise, the circle will show only
an
upper-bound estimate of the pointing error during the 'adjustment'
phases. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
You
can connect or disconnect&nbsp;the "Ask for
coordinates" aux-mount&nbsp;without affecting the camera or mount
connections. &nbsp;So you might decide to use the option for drift
alignment or for an initial slew to your imaging target, then
disconnect from it in order to avoid
the repetitive dialog displays. &nbsp;Regardless of how you choose
to
use it, you're
responsible for having the correct values in place, and you should
remember that significantly wrong values can result in poor guiding
results.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Advanced_Settings_for_the_Simulators"></a>Advanced
Settings for the Simulators</h3>
The device simulators were introduced in the <a href="Basic_use.htm">Basic
Use</a>
section as useful tools&nbsp;for experimenting with <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
and becoming
familiar with its features. &nbsp;Remember that you must choose
'Simulator' as the camera type and 'On-camera' as the mount type in
order to do useful simulation. &nbsp;As you become more
interested in the details of the simulation, you can use the 'Camera
Settings'&nbsp;button on the main display to adjust the simulation
parameters:<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 659px; height: 543px;" alt="" src="Tools_simulator.png"><br>
<br>
<br>
You can adjust simulated mount behaviors for declination backlash,
drift
due to polar mis-alignment, and periodic error. &nbsp;You can also
adjust the 'seeing' level, which will create fairly realistic guide
star deflections that look like seeing effects. &nbsp;If you adjust
these parameters one-by-one, you'll see how they affect star
deflections and how the different guide algorithms react to those
movements. &nbsp;Of course, you're dealing with a "nearly perfect"
mount in
these scenarios (except for backlash), so the simulation can't be
entirely realistic. &nbsp;The simulation dialog is primarily used for

<h3><a name="Multiple_Executions"></a>Multiple
Program Executions</h3>
In
some situations, you may want to run multiple instances of PHD2 at the
same time. &nbsp;To start the second instance of PHD2, you need to
supply a command-line parameter of -i 2; the third instance would be
started with -i 3, etc. &nbsp;You can accomplish this in Windows by
running PHD2 from a command line using the Windows cmd.exe utility.
&nbsp;Or you can create a Windows desktop shortcut by doing the
following: <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Right-click on your desktop<br>
Select: New/Shortcut<br>
Enter the following string to identify the location of the program:
"C:\Program File (x86)\PHDBuiding2\PHD2.exe" -i2<br>
Click Next<br>
Enter a name for the shortcut, e.g.&nbsp;PHD2 #2<br>
Click Finish<br>
</div>
<br>
Note the quotes around the name in the 3rd line are required by Windows
because there are blanks embedded in the directory name.<br>
<h3><a name="Keyboard_Shortcuts"></a>Keyboard
Shortcuts</h3>
Keyboard
shortcuts are available for many of the more commonly used tools and
functions in PHD2. &nbsp;These are enumerated in the <a href="KeyboardShortcuts.htm">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>
section.
<h3><a name="Software_Update"></a>Software
Update</h3>
<p>
One of the most common responses to a request for support in the PHD2
Forum is: please upgrade to the latest version and see if the problem
still exists. If you are seeing an issue in an older version of PHD2
it is quite likely that you are not the first person to encounter it,
and&nbsp;it has already been discovered and fixed in a newer version of
PHD2. For this reason, the developers of PHD2 feel that it is
important to be running the most up-to-date version of the program.
</p>
<p>Updating a program that you rely on for unattended imaging can
sometimes be perceived as a risky
proposition. The developers of PHD2 recognize this sentiment--we are
imagers too! There is a necessary trade-off between maintaining a
stable software installation and staying current with the latest
bug fixes and other improvements. &nbsp;In some cases, camera vendors
will issue "breaking" changes to their software drivers and SDKs, often
because they have introduced a new camera model. &nbsp;This poses a
problem for us because we are forced to update the camera SDK in order
to support the new camera. &nbsp;But this also means that current users
may encounter problems with a camera and drivers that have been working
well, something that can only be corrected by upgrading to the latest
camera drivers and the latest version of PHD2.</p>
<p>PHD2 achieves a balance between these two opposing needs by
publishing two series of software releases. The development releases
contain the latest ongoing bug fixes and feature improvements and are
tested by the developers--usually during actual imaging time--before
being released. Users who choose to run the development releases will
get the latest bug fixes and newest features. Development releases
have names like "2.6.3dev6" indicating, for example, the 6th
development release after the 2.6.3 major release.</p>
<p>Periodically, after a development release has received more
test
time, it will be published as a major release. For example, 2.6.3dev6
could be published as major release 2.6.4.</p>
<h4>Checking for updates</h4>
<p>PHD2 has an option to automatically check for software
updates. We
recommend enabling this option to help keep your version of
PHD2 up to date. When the automatic check option is enabled, PHD2
will&nbsp;check for updates in the background when PHD2 starts. If new
updates are available, PHD2 will give you the option to install the
new version. Enabling the automatic check for updates will not
interfere with the ordinary operation of PHD2, including automated
operation. It is also safe to leave the option enabled if you are
imaging in the field without internet connectivity. If PHD2 cannot
check for updates, it will wait until the next time it is started
before
trying to check again.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you allow PHD2 to automatically check
for
updates at startup, you can always manually check for updates by
clicking "Check for updates" from the Help menu.</p>
