<h2>Main Screen</h2>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> main window is designed for ease of use and clarity.
&nbsp;Its intent is to support a quick and natural sequence of
interactions to start and control guiding. &nbsp;The basic steps
for doing this are as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>Connect to the PHD2 configuration profile that establishes your guide camera and mount connections</li>
<li>Start a sequence of guide exposures to see what stars are
available in the field of view</li>
<li>Let PHD2 auto-select&nbsp;suitable stars and calibrate the guider</li>
<li>Continue guiding on the target star while using various
display tools to see how things are going</li>
<li>Stop and resume guiding as necessary</li>
</ol>
<img style="width: 670px; height: 522px;" alt="" src="Main_Screen.png"><br>
<p>The majority of the screen is taken up by the display of the image
from your guide camera - under normal nighttime conditions, that will
show the stars available for guiding. &nbsp;The display is
automatically
adjusted for size, brightness, and contrast so you can view
the&nbsp;available stars. &nbsp;However, these adjustments are done
only
for display purposes. &nbsp;Internally, <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
operates on the raw,
un-adjusted data in order to maximize guiding accuracy. &nbsp;This
display can also used to manually select a guide star by&nbsp; clicking
on it although it's better to use the 'Auto-select star' feature..
&nbsp;You can adjust the slider control to&nbsp;see
even the faintest stars in the field.<br></p>
<h3><a name="Basic_control"></a>Basic control</h3>Near the bottom of the screen are the main
controls. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> is largely controlled by these buttons and
sliders, with additional pull-down menus at the top of the window for
more detailed functions. Moving from left to right in the
window, the primary buttons are as follows: <br><ol><li>The USB connector icon - used to connect to the PHD2 profile that defines your equipment connecttions</li><li>The Loop icon - used to start a sequence of repeated exposures with the
guide camera ("looping"), with each resultant image (guide frame) being
displayed in the main window. &nbsp;If guiding is subsequently started,
clicking on the 'loop' icon again will pause guiding while continuing
to take guide exposures.</li><li>The
Auto-Select Star icon - used to trigger an automatic selection of the
best guide star candidates in the field of view. &nbsp;This selection
is
done quantitatively, taking many things into account - star saturation,
minimum star size, signal-to-noise ratio, proximity to other stars,
proximity to the edge of the field, etc. &nbsp;Auto-selection is the
recommended method for choosing guide stars and is the only way to use
multi-star guiding.</li><li>The PHD2/Guide icon - used to start calibration, if needed, and then to start guiding on the selected star. &nbsp;</li><li>The Stop icon - used to stop both guiding and&nbsp;looping </li></ol><ol type="1">
</ol>To the right of the stop icon is a pull-down list of exposure
durations (0.01s - 15s). &nbsp;You use this control to quickly set the guide
camera's exposure duration. &nbsp;If your camera does not support an
exposure duration, <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> will do its best to emulate that duration.
&nbsp;For example, if you use a short-exposure webcam, your maximum
true exposure duration might be only 1/30th of a second. &nbsp;If you
select one second as the desired exposure time, <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> will automatically
acquire images for one second and stack them on the fly to create a
composite image for guiding.
<p>The next control to the right is a slider for adjusting screen
stretch and contrast, essentially a "gamma" adjustment. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
automatically adjusts the display accounting for the darkest and
brightest pixels in the image, and the slider is used to fine-tune the
display to better see the stars in the field of view.
&nbsp;This may be useful, for example, if you are trying to focus the
guide camera for the first time and need to see the large, out-of-focus
star image. Moving the gamma slider only makes the display brighter or
dimmer for your viewing. <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
always uses the raw pixels from the camera for guiding, and moving the
gamma slider has no effect on guiding. &nbsp;A display of "completely
white" or "completely black" is usually an indication that no stars are
available in the field of view. &nbsp;The automatic gamma-stretching of
the image is a&nbsp;common source of confusion for users because they
don't adjust the gamma slider properly to see faint stars on the
display. &nbsp;The stars that PHD2 auto-selects may appear to be overly
faint and inferior to bright stars you see in the display. &nbsp;These
results are illusory because PHD2 can generally do a better job of
selecting a guide star than you can accomplish by eye. &nbsp;As a rule
of thumb, if you've chosen a star whose name is known to you, it is
almost certainly too bright to be a good choice as a guide star.</p>
<p>Next to the gamma slider is the&nbsp;"brain button." &nbsp;This button brings up an <a href="Advanced_settings.htm">Advanced Settings dialog </a>for making detailed adjustments to <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>'s
guiding operations. &nbsp;An important
design goal of the program is to minimize your need to change these
parameters, but "the brain" is&nbsp;nothing to be feared - there are
adjustments available there that can&nbsp;improve your guiding
results and make your life easier. &nbsp;That said, you should have a
clear understanding of what these parameters mean, and it is unwise to
simply change things in a blind attempt to improve your guiding - it
won't..
</p>The rightmost control in this row is a "camera properties" button.
&nbsp; Depending on your guide camera, this button may be enabled
to provide access to a configuration dialog&nbsp;unique to the camera.
&nbsp;However, common camera properties such as gain and binning will
normally be set in the 'Camera' tab of the PHD2 Advanced Settings dialog.&nbsp;
If the button is disabled, any&nbsp;available properties can be set in
the PHD2 Advanced Settings dialog. &nbsp;With the newer class of guide cameras,
this button is often disabled because it adds no capabilities beyond
what is available in the PHD2 Advanced Settings dialog.<br>
<h3><a name="Menus"></a>Menus</h3>The pull-down menus above the main guider display are used to access a variety of functions. &nbsp;These are described in the <a href="Darks_BadPixel_Maps.htm">Darks</a>, <a href="Tools.htm">Tools and Utilities</a><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></big></big>and <a href="Visualization.htm">Visualization&nbsp;</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>sections of this help document.
<h3><a name="Status_Bar"></a>Status Bar</h3><img style="width: 704px; height: 30px;" alt="" src="Main_Status.png"><br><br>The status bar at the
bottom of the main window is
used to display messages and status information that will help you keep
track of guiding operations. &nbsp; <br><br>Near
the center of the status bar are fields showing the current state of
the guide star. &nbsp;If the SNR value drops below 10, its value will
be shown in yellow as a warning that you may encounter some 'lost-star'
events. &nbsp;If the guide star is saturated, the field to the left of
SNR will show 'Saturated' in a red typeface.<br><br>To
the right of the
star status fields are two text fields showing the latest RA and Dec
guide commands. &nbsp;These show the size of the guide pulse, the guide
star displacement size&nbsp;in pixels, and an arrow showing the
direction.
&nbsp;The arrows follow the usual compass conventions: Dec up/down
corresponds to north/south, RA left/right corresponds to west/east.
&nbsp;All of this information is captured in the log files and
displayed in the various graphical tools, and those are what you should
use for visualizing your guide performance. &nbsp;But these status
fields may give you a quick visual clue when something is behaving
unusually.<br><br>The rightmost panels in the status
bar show icons that give you visual clues about the current state of
PHD2:. &nbsp;These icons are color-coded to give you a dashboard view of current status and have the following meanings:<br><br>'Dark'
- red means neither a dark library nor a bad-pixel map is being used,
green means one or the other is&nbsp;in-use. &nbsp;If you're
using a bad-pixel map, the text will say 'BPM' rather than 'Dark'<br><br>'Cal'
- shows the state of calibration. &nbsp;Red means the mount is
currently uncalibrated, while yellow means there is a calibration but it
isn't being adjusted automatically to account for scope pointing
position. &nbsp;This will happen when you aren't using either an ASCOM
or 'aux' mount connection in PHD2. &nbsp;If the icon is yellow, you
will generally need to recalibrate when you move the scope to different
declination positions.<br><br>"The Ball" - shows whether all the
equipment in your profile has been successfully connected. &nbsp;If the
ball is yellow, some components are not connected, while green means
everything is connected.<br><br>If you hover the mouse cursor over any of these status icons, you'll see details about the current state.<br><br>
