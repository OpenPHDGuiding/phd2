/// \class CVPlatform CVPlatform.h
/// Platform-specific object factory
///
/// CVPlatform is a singleton class factory for platform-specific classes.
/// This allows us to instantiate totally different objects on different
/// platforms without making the calling code platform-specific or requiring
/// subclassing.
///
/// When setting up a project for a specific platform, make sure to add in
/// the appropriate CVPlatform*.cpp for that platform. It implements
/// the CVPlatform class for us.  Also make sure to include the
/// platform-specific .cpp file for each class we use CVPlatform to
/// create.
