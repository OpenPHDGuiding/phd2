<body><h2>Dark Frames and Bad-pixel Maps</h2><br><h3>Introduction</h3>Cameras
used for guiding are typically not temperature-regulated and may
produce&nbsp;images that appear quite "noisy." &nbsp;As a result, guide
exposures frequently show obvious "defects" in the form of &nbsp;"hot"
("stuck") pixels or regions with spurious brightness levels. &nbsp;If
there are too many of these defects, you may have trouble identifying
and selecting a good guide star - trying to calibrate on a hot pixel is
a common problem for beginners. &nbsp;Even after guiding has begun, a
spurious hot pixel close to the guide star can disrupt the calculations
needed for smooth guiding and may case the software to "jump" between
the real star and the hot pixel. &nbsp;These sorts of problems can be
mitigated by using either of two approaches in PHD2: dark frames and
bad pixel maps. &nbsp;All functions related to dark frames and bad-pixel maps are located under the top-level 'Darks' menu.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3><a name="Dark_Frames"></a>Dark Frames</h3>PHD2 will
build and use a "library" of dark frames that match the range of
exposures you use for guiding. &nbsp;Once the library is built, it will
be saved automatically and will be available for use across multiple
PHD2 sessions. &nbsp;As a result, you can spend a modest amount of time
to build a good dark library, then use that library for an extended
period of time. &nbsp;Once you have connected to your camera, you can
build a dark library from the 'Dark Library...' item under the
top-level 'Darks' menu. &nbsp;That will start a dialog that looks like
this: <br><br><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><img style="width: 503px; height: 319px;" alt="Dark_Library" src="Dark_Lib.png"><br><br>You
use the two controls at the top to specify the minimum and maximum
exposure times that will be used to acquire dark frames. &nbsp;The
starting, ending, and intermediate values match the exposure times used
in the main PHD2 window, so you can acquire dark frames that will match
any exposure time you choose for guiding. &nbsp;The third control
specifies the number of dark frames that will be acquired and averaged
for each exposure time. &nbsp;The averaged image is referred to as a
"master dark frame." &nbsp;Historically, PHD has used 5 dark frames for
this purpose, but you may want to increase that number to improve the
quality of the master dark frame. &nbsp;You can also add a note or
comment if you wish - this will be embedded in the header of the master
dark frames for later reference. &nbsp;<br><br>One
you've set your
parameters, click on 'Start' to begin the process. &nbsp;If your guide
camera does not have a shutter - most do not - you'll be prompted by
PHD2 to cover the guide scope. &nbsp;To get the best results, be sure
there is no light leakage into the guide camera - doing this in
daylight is not likely to work well. &nbsp;PHD2 will systematically
work through the range of exposure times you've chosen, taking the
specified number of frames for each exposure time. &nbsp;Progress will
be displayed on the status bar at the bottom of the window, so you can
see where you are in the overall process. &nbsp;Once you've started the
process, the 'Cancel' button above will change to a 'Stop' button.
&nbsp;You can click on this if something goes wrong or you want to
change the parameters before the entire sequence completes.
&nbsp;Stopping in this way will discard whatever data has already been
collected, so you'll need to make your corrections and then restart the
process. &nbsp; Once all the frames have been collected, PHD2 will
compute the master dark frames, store them in a dark library data file,
then show a message box summarizing the results. &nbsp;If your
camera has no shutter, you'll also be prompted to uncover the guide
scope so you can return to normal imaging.<br><br>Once your dark
library has been built, you control its use by the 'Use Dark Library'
&nbsp;item under the 'Darks' menu. &nbsp;The checkbox on the menu item
will toggle on or off each time you click on it. &nbsp;The setting of
the item is retained across program executions, so if you choose to
leave the menu item checked, PHD2 will automatically load the dark
library and resume its use the next time you run the application.
&nbsp;The dark library itself is retained on disk until you build a new
library, so you can freely change the setting on the 'Use Dark Library'
menu item without loss of any data. &nbsp;If you are using a dark
library and there is no master dark frame that exactly matches your
guide exposure time, PHD2 will use the "nearest" fit. &nbsp;However,
you are encouraged to obtain matching master dark frames for best
results. &nbsp;If you have a dark library that has "missing" exposure
times, you can simply acquire the missing data and it will be added to
the existing dark library - there is no need to start over. &nbsp;By
changing the setting of the 'Use Dark Library' menu item, you'll be
able to see the effect of using the dark library and determine whether your guider images are sufficiently improved.<br><h3><a name="Bad-pixel_Maps"></a>Bad-pixel Maps (<a name="Defect_Maps"></a>Defect Maps)</h3>For
some guide cameras, dark frames don't do an adequate job of removing
the defective pixels that are visible in the guide frame. &nbsp;In
those situations, you can probably get better results by building and
using a bad-pixel map. &nbsp;This approach directly measures and
compensates for specific areas of the sensor that produce false signal
(hot/stuck pixels) or don't respond correctly to incoming light (cold
pixels). &nbsp;Such a "map" is created by taking a sequence of
comparatively long dark exposures (e.g. 15 seconds), averaging them,
then statistically analyzing the resultant frame to identify the
locations of defective pixels. &nbsp;These pixel locations are saved
for future use. &nbsp;During normal guiding, each of these pixel
locations on the guide image is replaced by a statistical sample of the
surrounding pixels, thus eliminating all or most of the effect of the
"bad" pixel. &nbsp;The final result is usually an image with a smoother
background and fewer obvious defects. &nbsp;For any defects that
remain, PHD2 also provides a way for you to manually click on
bad pixel locations and add them to the map. &nbsp;This entire process
of obtaining and analyzing dark frames&nbsp;is handled for
you by&nbsp;PHD2, so it's easy to build a bad-pixel map.<br><br>Building
a bad-pixel map is done by clicking on the 'Bad Pixel Map...' item
under the top-level 'Darks' menu. &nbsp;If you are doing this for the
first time, you will be prompted to obtain a sequence of dark frames
for analyzing your camera sensor and building the map: <br><br><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><img style="width: 489px; height: 270px;" alt="Defect_Darks" src="Defect_Darks.png"><br><br>This
is a slightly different version of the dialog used for obtaining dark
frames, described in the previous section. &nbsp;Because the analysis
is based on statistics, you should use relatively long exposure times
(&gt; 10 sec) and at least 10 frames. &nbsp;Since the bad-pixel map can
be re-used for fairly long time periods, you won't have to repeat this
operation very often, and it's worth spending some time to get higher
quality data. <br><br>Once the dark frames have been captured, PHD2
will compute the statistics and identify an initial set of defective or
"suspect" pixel locations. &nbsp;After a short delay, you'll&nbsp;then
see a dialog that looks something like this: <br><br><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"></span><img style="width: 653px; height: 514px;" alt="Bad-pixel Map" src="DefectUI.png"><br><br>The
'General Information' section shows a summary of the statistics
computed by PHD2 during the identification of bad pixel locations.
&nbsp;Normally, you won't need to look at these, and you can hide this
portion of the display by clearing&nbsp;the 'Show Master Dark Details'
checkbox. &nbsp;The "Results" group shows the counts for hot and cold
pixels based on the current settings of the two "Aggressivness" sliders
below them. &nbsp;If you're doing this for the first time, the
aggressiveness sliders will be set at their default values, 75 within
the range of 0 to 100. &nbsp;You'll need to experiment or make some
judgment about whether the counts look reasonable based on what you see
on your normal guide frames. &nbsp;If you adjust the aggressiveness
sliders left and right, you'll see the hot and cold pixel counts
change. &nbsp;The sliders&nbsp;control how "aggressive" PHD2
should be in identifying suspect pixels and flagging them as being
defective - so higher aggressiveness settings will result in higher
pixel counts. &nbsp; Once the settings are where you want them, click
on the 'Generate' button to compute and load the new defect map. &nbsp;<br><br>At
this point, you'll probably want to examine the results. &nbsp;The main
window of PHD2 is still active, so you can take a normal guide exposure
to see how things look. &nbsp;If you want to quickly see the result of
using the defect map, just toggle the 'Use Bad-pixel Map' menu item
under the 'Darks' menu. &nbsp; Keep in mind that you don't need to
achieve a perfectly smooth, black background in the guider image - you
just need to have a sufficiently small number of remaining hot/cold
pixels that neither you nor the PHD2 guiding algorithms will mistake a
bad pixel for a star. &nbsp;If you "over-correct" with very aggressive
settings, you may create so many bad pixel areas that they interfere
with detection of usable guide stars. &nbsp;It's easy to make
adjustments with the sliders &nbsp;- just change the slider settings,
click on 'Generate' again, and look at the results in the main PHD2
window.<br><br>You may find that this statistical approach still leaves
a few hot pixels that you'd&nbsp;like to eliminate. &nbsp; You can do
this quickly and easily by manually adding the bad pixels to the map.
&nbsp;Just use the main PHD2 window to take a guide exposure, then
click on the hot pixel you want to remove. &nbsp;PHD2 will highlight
that area with the green tracking box, at which time you can click on
the 'Add Bad Pixel' button in the dialog box shown above. &nbsp;This
automatically updates the map with the pixel location you just identified
and immediately reloads the map, so you should see the result in the
next guide exposure you take. &nbsp;You can continue with this process
until you are satisfied with the results. &nbsp;Remember, you don't
need "perfect", just "good enough." &nbsp;<br><br>Once
your bad-pixel
map has been built, you control its use by the 'Use Bad-pixel Map'
&nbsp;item under the 'Darks' menu. &nbsp;This setting is retained
across program executions, so leaving it checked will tell PHD2 to
automatically load the defect map and use it for all guide exposures.
&nbsp;The settings for 'Use Dark Library' and 'Use Bad-pixel Map' are
mutually exclusive - you can&nbsp;use one or neither, but not both at
the same time. &nbsp;As with the dark library, the bad-pixel map data
file is stored permanently, so you can disable its use without losing
any data. &nbsp;Both of these data structures can be used for extended
time periods, but it's worth remembering that camera sensors do change
over time. &nbsp;As a result, you may want to rebuild the dark library
or bad-pixel maps at periodic intervals or when you start to see a
degradation in the appearance of your normal guide images. &nbsp;In
these cases, it is also advisable to click on the checkbox for 'Rebuild
Master Dark Frame', which will tell PHD2 to reacquire the underlying
dark frames and recompute a baseline bad-pixel map. &nbsp;You'll then
need to refine the map as you did before until you're happy with the
results. &nbsp;There is no reason you should need to interact with
either the dark libarary or bad-pixel map data files, but you can find
them located in the 'AppData\Local' logical directory used by your
operating system.<br><br></body></html>
