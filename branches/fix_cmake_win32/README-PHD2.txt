Welcome to PHD2 Release Version 2.5.0

PHD2 is the next generation of Craig Stark's original PHD Guiding application, now
restructured, enhanced, and supported by an open-source community of volunteers.
PHD2's new built-in help file is an excellent way to get started using the program,
regardless of whether you've had previous experience with the original PHD.
