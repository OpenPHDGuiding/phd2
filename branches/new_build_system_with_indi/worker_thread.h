/*
 * There are two worker threads in PHD.  The primary thread handles all exposure requests,
 * and move requests for the first mount.  The secondary thread handles move requests for the
 * second mount, so that on systems with two mounts (probably an AO and a telescope), the
 * second mount can be moving while we image and guide with the first mount.
 *
 * The worker threads have three queues, one for move requests (higher priority)
 * and one for exposure requests (lower priority) and one "wakeup queue". The wx queue
 * routines do not have a way to wait on multiple queues, so there is no easy way
 * to implement the dual queue priority model without a third queue.
 *
 * When something is enqueued on either of the work queues, a dummy message is
 * also enqueued on the wakeup queue, which wakes the thread up.  It then finds
 * the work item by looking first on the high priority queue and then the low
 * priority queue.
