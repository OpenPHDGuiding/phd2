<h2>Main Screen</h2>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> main window is designed for ease of use and clarity.
&nbsp;Its intent is to support a quick and natural sequence of
interactions to start and control guiding. &nbsp;The basic steps
for doing this are as follows:<br>
<ol>
<li>Connect to your guide camera and mount</li>
<li>Start a sequence of guide exposures to see what stars are
available in the field of view</li>
<li>Choose a guide star and calibrate the guider</li>
<li>Continue guiding on the target star while using various
display tools to see how things are going</li>
<li>Stop and resume guiding as necessary</li>
</ol>
<img style="width: 690px; height: 591px;" alt="" src="Main_Screen.png"><br>
<p>The majority of the screen is taken up by the display of the star
field from your guide camera. &nbsp;The display is automatically
adjusted for size, brightness, and contrast so you can have a clear
view of available stars. &nbsp;However, these adjustments are done only
for display purposes. &nbsp;Internally, <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> operates on the raw,
un-adjusted data in order to maximize guiding accuracy. &nbsp;This
display is also used to select a guide star by simply clicking on it.<br></p>
<h3><a name="Basic_control"></a>Basic control</h3>Near the bottom of the screen are the main
controls. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> is largely controlled by these buttons and
sliders, with additional pull-down menus at the top of the window for
more detailed functions. &nbsp;Moving from left to right in the
window, the primary buttons are as follows: <br><ol><li>The camera icon - used to connect to your camera and mount devices</li><li>The
loop icon - used to start a sequence of repeated exposures with the
guide camera ("looping"), with each resultant image (guide frame) being
displayed in the main window. &nbsp;If guiding is subsequently started,
clicking on the 'loop' icon again will pause guiding while continuing
to take guide exposures.</li><li>The guide/target icon - used to start calibration, if needed, and then to start guiding on the selected star. &nbsp;</li><li>The stop icon - used to stop both guiding and&nbsp;looping </li></ol><ol type="1">
</ol>To the right of the stop icon is a pull-down list of exposure
durations (0.01s - 15s). &nbsp;You use this control to quickly set the guide
camera's exposure duration. &nbsp;If your camera does not support an
exposure duration, <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> will do its best to emulate that duration.
&nbsp;For example, if you use a short-exposure webcam, your maximum
true exposure duration might be only 1/30th of a second. &nbsp;If you
select one second as the desired exposure time, <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span> will automatically
acquire images for one second and stack them on the fly to create a
composite image for guiding.
<p>The next control to the right is a slider for adjusting screen
stretch and contrast, essentially a "gamma" adjustment. &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
automatically adjusts the display accounting for the darkest and
brightest pixels in the image, and the slider is used to fine-tune the
display to better see the stars in the field of view.
&nbsp;This may be useful, for example, if you are trying to focus the
guide camera for the first time and need to see the large, out-of-focus
star image. Moving the gamma slider only makes the display brighter or
dimmer for your viewing. <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>
always uses the raw pixels from the camera for guiding, and moving the
gamma slider has no effect on guiding. &nbsp;A display of "completely
white" or "completely black" is usually an indication that no stars are
available in the field of view.</p>
<p>Next to the gamma slider is the so-called "brain button." &nbsp;This button brings up an <a href="Advanced_settings.htm">Advanced Dialog </a>for making detailed adjustments to <span style="font-style: italic;">PHD2</span>'s guiding operations. &nbsp;A major
design goal of the program is to minimize your need to change these
parameters, but "the brain" is&nbsp;nothing to be feared - there are
adjustments available here that can significantly improve your
experience. &nbsp;Over a period of time, you should take a look at this
dialog and learn what it can do for you.
</p>The rightmost control in this row is a "camera
dialog" button. &nbsp;This may be disabled ("grayed out") depending on
the type of guide camera you have selected. &nbsp;If it is enabled, you
can click on it to set various parameters that are unique to that type
of camera - binning and specialized gain settings are examples of such parameters, but there
could be others depending on the camera.
<h3><a name="Menus"></a>Menus</h3>The pull-down menus above the main guider display are used to access a variety of functions. &nbsp;These are described in the <a href="Darks_BadPixel_Maps.htm">Darks</a>, <a href="Tools.htm">Tools and Utilities</a><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span></big></big>and <a href="Visualization.htm">Visualization&nbsp;</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>sections of this help document.
<h3><a name="Status_Bar"></a>Status Bar</h3>The status bar at the bottom of the main window is
used to display messages and status information that will help you keep
track of guiding operations. &nbsp;For example, the rightmost three
panels on the status bar will show you whether the camera and mount are
connected and whether the guider has been successfully calibrated.
